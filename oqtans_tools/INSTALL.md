#### Before using oqtans package, 

#### Run

    bash ./oqtans_make.sh all 

    to compile all needed software components of oqtans tools.

#### Include the content of 

    tool_conf.xml.oqtans into your GALAXY tool_conf.xml file and 
    
    See the README file for integrating built-in genome reference index to the tools.

Source oqtans/oqtans_config.sh and restart galaxy instace.

    Now you should be able to use oqtans with or without your GALAXY instance.
