**Introduction**

This is KIRMES: Kernel-based Identification of Regulatory Modules
in Euchromatic Sequences. KIRMES predicts coregulation based on
gene sets that exhibit similar behavior. 

You can upload a pair of FASTA files, containing the regulatory region
of genes e.g. from a microarray experiment, ChIP-chip binding or 
next generation sequencing data. A comparison to common motif finding 
methods and data about its effectiveness has been published in [1].

The following is a description of the Motif Finding, Training and 
Prediction tools found on this web server.

If you have additional questions about KIRMES, please write an
email to sebi@tue.mpg.de. For problems with our Galaxy server, please 
write to galaxy@tue.mpg.de

**Prediction**

This tool uses an unlabeled FASTA file and a trained KIRMES predictor as input. 
It returns the FASTA header names of each entry and a classification: It is positive,
i.e. +1, if this promoter region contains enough similarities to the ones in 
the positive input dataset, and negative otherwise.

**About formats**



**FASTA format** A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line
description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line
is distinguished from the sequence data by a "greater than" (>) symbol
in the first column. The token until the first space or the end of the 
line is used as an identifier for the sequence. The remainder of the 
description line is ignored.

An example sequence in FASTA format is:

>CHR1

**GFF3 format** General Feature Format is a format for describing genes
and other features associated with DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. GFF
lines have nine tab-separated fields:

    1. seqname - The name of the chromosome or scaffold (e.g., chr1, chrY_random).
    2. source - The program that generated this feature.
    3. feature - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are "CDS", "start_codon", "stop_codon", and "exon".
    4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. (The first base on a chromosome is numbered 1.)
    5. end - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).
    6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter ".".
    7. strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.
    8. frame - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0 and 2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.
    9. group - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.

**TKP format** Trained KIRMES Predictor is an internal structure that
contains the complete trained model including information about every
motif and its contribution to the classification accuracy.
